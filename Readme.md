# SIH Project: Accelerating High-Fidelity Road Network Modeling for Indian Traffic Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust solution for high-fidelity road network modeling, tailored for Indian traffic simulation. The goal is to accelerate the creation, validation, and deployment of realistic road network models to support research, planning, and policy-making.

## Problem Statement

Indian road networks are complex and diverse, making accurate traffic simulation challenging. Existing models often lack the granularity and adaptability required for real-world scenarios. Our solution addresses these gaps by leveraging advanced data processing, machine learning, and scalable architecture.

## Key Features

- **Automated Road Network Extraction:** Uses satellite imagery and GIS data to generate detailed road maps.
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis:** Integrates real-time and historical traffic data for realistic simulation.
- **Scalable Simulation Engine:** Supports large-scale, multi-agent traffic simulations.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows tuning for various urban and rural scenarios.
- **Visualization Tools:** Interactive dashboards for model validation and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow
- GIS libraries (QGIS, GeoPandas)
- Simulation frameworks (SUMO, MATSim)
- Web technologies (React, D3.js)


## Usage

1. Prepare input data (satellite images, traffic logs).
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to extract road networks.
3. Configure simulation parameters in `config.yaml`.
4. Start the simulation engine:
    ```bash
    python simulate.py --config config.yaml
    ```
5. View results in the dashboard.
